        "a1": "Right now, <strong>VoiceScribe is 100% FREE</strong> for a limited time. We want you to try the tool with zero barriers. We may introduce paid plans later, but if you join now you'll enjoy everything at no cost.",
        "q2": "How accurate is the transcription?",
        "a2": "We use advanced Web Speech API technology, achieving over <strong>95% accuracy</strong> in clear audio conditions. It works best with a good microphone and moderate background noise.",
        "q3": "Does it work with Zoom, Google Meet or YouTube?",
        "a3": "Yes. VoiceScribe captures your microphone audio. If you use speakers, it will pick up meeting or video audio too. For best results, use your system's \"Stereo Mix\" mode if available.",
        "q4": "Is my data safe?",
        "a4": "Absolutely. <strong>Privacy is our #1 priority.</strong> Transcriptions are processed locally in your browser. We only send text to OpenAI when you explicitly request a summary, and nothing is stored on our servers.",
        "q5": "Do I need my own OpenAI key?",
        "a5": "No. Since VoiceScribe is free, you can use our AI directly. If you prefer to use your own API key for more control, we offer that option in settings."
